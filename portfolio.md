I would like to say that I am a Full Stack Developer. But, is it possible to ever be full-stack, when the stack goes all the way down to the metal? Instead, I will call myself a Work In Progress. And I am here to learn.

Working solely on proprietary software has left me with little to show by way of work samples. So, I will demonstrate my skills by listing my open source contributions here.

## Technology

### 1. This Blog
When done well, a website can be the best showcase of a developer's skills. Let's talk about my blog - START.HALF DONE.

My [blog]({{site.url}}) is
* a static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) 
* hosted on an [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* secured by an SSL certificate from [AWS Certificate Manager(ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) 
* compliant with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) practices -
When the master branch is updated, [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) automatically triggers [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) to build Jekyll in a standard Linux environment. The changes are synced to the bucket and the cache is invalidated to serve the latest version of the website.

For source control, I use [GitHub](https://github.com/startanant).

I've been working with JavaScript and the MERN (Mongo Express ReactJS NodeJS) stack lately. Here are some samples with live demos.

## Writing

I also like to write about technology and break down complex topics into easily understandable blog posts. 

**JavaScript**

**Python**

[A needle in a haystack: Part II]({{site.url}}tech/2019/09/30/find-needles-2.html)

**GitHub**

## Video

I enjoy creating technical video content - beginner-friendly video tutorials featuring live coding in the terminal, IDE and browser.
You can check out my videos on YouTube.

## Social Media
When not working, I am found elsewhere on the internet, looking at cat pictures or posting images of a meal.
